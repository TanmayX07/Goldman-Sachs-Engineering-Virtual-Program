`What level of protection does the mechanism offer for passwords?`

`What controls could be implemented to make cracking much harder for the hacker in the event of a password database leaking again?`

`What can you tell about the organizationâ€™s password policy (e.g. password length, key space, etc.)?`

`What would you change in the password policy to make breaking the passwords harder?`
